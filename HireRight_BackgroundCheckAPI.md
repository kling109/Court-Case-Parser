## OVERVIEW
### Approach
Our approach was to keep it simple, simulate how a human would grab background data on a candidate. This required us to break the challenge into two main categories: **Navigation** and **Parsing**. 
<br/>
Like a user, the program must recognize where the search bar is on the page and "click" key buttons that are necessary to reach the candidate's data. Since this program must also be flexible and applicable across many court sites, it must "walk through" through the HTML tags, or text in the tags, to know where these key buttons are located in the website.
